            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Decode YouTube Sentiments.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>

            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>The information provided by users is used solely for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fetching and analyzing YouTube comments.</li>
                <li>Generating insights based on the provided data.</li>

            <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
            <p>We do not permanently store any user-provided data, including comments or API keys. All processing is done in real-time during the user session. Any data collected is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the service request and is deleted afterward.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement industry-standard measures, such as SSL encryption, to protect user data during transmission. However, no system is entirely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute security against unauthorized access or data breaches.</p>

            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>This platform uses the YouTube Data API to fetch and analyze comments. Users are subject to YouTube’s Privacy Policy when interacting with YouTube services. Additionally, we may use third-party services for data hosting, analytics, and security purposes. Please review their privacy policies for more information.</p>

            <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
            <p>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies to monitor user behavior. If we introduce cookies in the future, we will update this policy accordingly and notify users.</p>
